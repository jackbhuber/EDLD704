<p>In your setting, surely you’ve seen data collected and presented in various ways to get your attention, stimulate your thinking, illuminate an issue, and the like. Maybe you’ve done such data-related work yourself.</p>
<p>Like appreciation for fine art or food acquired over time, you probably have a sense of “bad” data when you see it.</p>
<p>Do you also have a sense of “good” data when you see it? …. even if you don’t like what it suggests?</p>
<p>My overarching hope for this course is to help you collect better data from now on by focusing your attention on how data are collected: methods for conducting inquiry, which includes considerations how to collect data in ways that optimize their quality.</p>
<p>This concerns of this first module are the question and decision of what method to use to carry out a study.&nbsp;As I see it, methods depend, fundamentally, on the nature of the question being asked: What specific kind of information or understanding does the question seek? Here I make a fundamental and admittedly over-simplistic distinction between qualities and quantities.</p>
<p>To investigate questions that betray interest in quantities – “To what extent…?”, “How prevalent…?”, “What predicts….?” – one should use quantitative methods, such as surveys, experimental and quasi-experimental designs, and secondary analyses of quantitative data.</p>
<p>To investigate questions that betray interest in qualities, we employ qualitative designs and instruments such as interviews, observations, in-depth case studies, analysis of content, and the like.</p>
<p>Often, the question is so self-evident that the choices of methods and instrumentation are obvious.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But perhaps just as often we are interested in both, and the qualities-quantities distinction is not so clear cut. To illustrate, consider this case study:</p>
<section id="a-case-study" class="level2" data-number="1.1">
<h2 data-number="1.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a-case-study"><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> A Case Study</h2>
<p>In 2006, all public high schools in Washington State were required to administer the state’s large-scale assessment, the Washington Assessments of Student Learning (WASL) in mathematics and reading, to all tenth grade students. These students were the first graduating class required to pass the test in order to receive their high school diplomas. High stakes accountability testing was getting “real.”</p>
<p>Public educators throughout the state were anxious. Questions abounded:</p>
<p>How many students would meet the standard? How close are we?</p>
<p>Which students are less likely to reach the standard?</p>
<p>What reforms, interventions, or other restructuring are necessary in elementary and middle school to better prepare students for the high school proficiency standard?</p>
<p>What exactly are the high school proficiency standards in reading and math?</p>
<p>What reforms, interventions, or other restructuring are necessary in high school to better prepare students who failed the test in tenth grade to pass the test by their senior year?</p>
<p>There were many critics of the state policy. Many decried the requirements as fundamentally unfair. Leading psychometricians (experts in test design) criticized the high stakes policies as invalid uses of largely high quality tests. Some public educators retired early or found other jobs. Others defended the policies as necessary to bring about long overdue reforms. Those in the district where I worked grumbled and complained … and got to work to help our students succeed.</p>
<p>At the time, I was early in my career in public education. I was employed as a data analyst in my district’s Curriculum and Instruction department while working on my doctorate. My job, in essence, was to help educators understand student achievement data. I was unique because I had come to education not from classroom teaching but academic sociology. I saw things differently. At the risk of being dismissed as young, naive, and “ivory tower”, I was decidedly less partisan and more curious than others. The specific changes were hard, and many resisted, but that didn’t mean some change was necessary, and I cared more what the data said than what people claimed.</p>
<p>Here are the kinds of questions I asked at the time:</p>
<p>What is the historical and/or social scientific evidence that these high stakes testing policies actually work? Where and when have these policies already worked? And what does “actually work” mean: To improve instruction? To help students overcome demographic disadvantages?&nbsp; One important part of the theory of action of these high-stakes testing policies is “measurement-driven instruction”: testing data should provide instructionally valuable feedback. Teachers should look at data; and when they do, they should see and do …. what? What does it mean for a district or school to be “data-driven”? How does a district or school become “data-driven”? High school teachers already see state assessment at a high level in the summer during inservice days. How often do they look at the state assessment data for their own students? And when they do, how much instructional utility do they derive from the data? The policies assume that external accountability pressure will cause teachers to look at data. Can I test that empirically? Do teachers who perceive more pressure tend to look at state assessment data more often than teachers who perceive less pressure? Professional learning communities are all the rage. They are hailed as a very effective model for organizing and motivating teachers to collaborate. Are high school teachers in professional learning communities more likely to use high school assessment data to improve instruction than those not in professional learning communities?</p>
<p>Now let’s consider all the different kinds of research questions in this topic.</p>
</section>
<section id="questions-for-quantitative-data" class="level2" data-number="1.2">
<h2 data-number="1.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="questions-for-quantitative-data"><span class="header-section-number">1.2</span> Questions for quantitative data</h2>
<p>The quantitative questions are fairly obvious:</p>
<p>How often do high school teachers use state assessment data? This is a question about frequency, which ranges from less frequent (“hardly ever’) to more frequent (”all the time”). To study this I needed a sample of teachers who used data with this full range of frequency. Are teachers who perceive more external accountability pressure to improve test scores more likely to examine their own students’ state assessment data more often? A pretty unmistakably quantitative research question (or hypothesis). Implied are scales of intensity for accountability pressure (less to more intense), frequency (“rarely” to “often”) of data use, and relationship (“more likely”) between these two variables. To study this I needed a sample of teachers who varied in their perceptions of accountability pressure and their frequency of data use.</p>
<p>Notice that questions for quantitative data come from an understanding of the situation with enough sophistication to know what the important variables are and how they might be related. In most cases, quantitative analysis is deductive; we know what to look for and we understand the situation well enough to test competing theories or understandings against the data.</p>
<p>Quantitative methods are also appropriate when you want to make generalizations about a population. They seek to show what is generally true of a large number of “cases” (most often, people).</p>
</section>
<section id="questions-for-qualitative-data" class="level2" data-number="1.3">
<h2 data-number="1.3" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="questions-for-qualitative-data"><span class="header-section-number">1.3</span> Questions for qualitative data</h2>
<p>Notice the questions that are more obviously about qualities than quantities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What does it mean for a district or school to be “data-driven”? Nothing here is quantified or quantifiable. The quest is for attributes or states of “data-driven”. The result could be a typology of different kinds of “data-driven”-ness.&nbsp; What does it mean for a teacher to “use” state assessment data? “Using state assessment data” could mean different things among high schools than my understanding from the district office or from professional research literature. I needed to talk to sample of teachers to ask them to describe how they use data in their own words. What do high school teachers learn from state assessment data? What sense do high school teachers make of state assessment data? Similar to the question above, I needed to ask teachers to describe what (if anything) they learn from state assessment data in their own words. How do state assessment data help high school teachers’ classroom instruction?</p>
<p>For each of these questions, the focus is full understanding of a small number of cases (most often, people). Generalization to a large population is NOT the point of qualitative methods. Qualitative methods aim to understand what is deeply true of a small number of cases.</p>
</section>
<section id="your-turn" class="level2" data-number="1.4">
<h2 data-number="1.4" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="your-turn"><span class="header-section-number">1.4</span> Your turn</h2>
<p>Having considered the different angles for research in this case study, now think about your own problem of practice as it seems to you in your setting or milieu.</p>
<p>Write down your guiding question/s that best capture your true interest. Use the Hemingway method to write “the truest possible” question/s.</p>
<p>Then consider the words you’ve used.</p>
<p>Are you looking to explore something that is not well understood? Do your questions seek understanding of kinds, ways in which, processes, stages, distinctions, classes, and the like? Are these things you can average? Do you seek understanding of the mental models, theories, understandings, and the like, of how someone in your setting of interest perceives something, or understands what they’re doing? Do you want their own words? Are you interested in the “theory of action” behind a program or organization? Are you interested in identities and self-understandings? Are people’s own metaphors interesting to you? Do you want to deal primarily with “words” data? If yes, then you may be primarily interested in qualitative methods.</p>
<p>Do you have a good enough understanding of your topic that you know what the important factors or variables are? Is one variable more important than another? Do you want a sense of scope, estimate, size, frequency, magnitude, intensity, extent, prevalence, risk, predictability, regularity, or relationship? Do you want to deal with primarily with “numbers” and “scale” data? If yes, then you may be primarily interested in quantitative methods.</p>
<p>Now a final word, for now, about mixed methods:</p>
<p>There are good reasons to use mixed methods. You may want to collect some qualitative data (from interviews, observations) from a few cases to more deeply understand something. With better firsthand understanding you can then develop more accurate survey items, frame more relevant questions and hypotheses, and test competing explanations of something.</p>
<p>My doctoral dissertation was de facto mixed methods. It began with qualitative work. From my role in the central office I knew a lot about my topic from a global perspective and from the professional literature, but I did not understand teacher work life very deeply. Interviewing a small sample of them helped me better understand my topic from their perspective. But I didn’t stop there; I wanted to make generalizations to a population of teachers. Based on this more sophisticated understanding I was able to frame smarter research questions and better survey items and to specify and estimate more grounded statistical models. My quantitative dissertation study proper owes its quality to the preliminary qualitative work that informed it.</p>
<p>Mixed methods are possible, and may appeal to you philosophically: “Why choose between the two if I can do both? Wouldn’t mixed methods make the most sense and do the most justice to the topic?” True enough. And what more appropriate laboratory for learning different research methods than your doctoral program? But to do any research method well is to negotiate a learning curve, and your time and energy are limited in this fast-paced doctoral program. Do factor that into your discernment of methods. Whatever you decide, I will help you as best I can.</p>
