    "text": "Description of the Course\nThe purpose of this course is to teach you about research methods and instruments for collecting data. The course will expose you to several research methods and offer guidance for collecting both quantitative and qualitative data. You should finish the course knowing:\n\nhow to select an appropriate research method for investigating a question for a study arising from a problem of practice\nhow to conceptualize, develop, and test an instrument for collecting data\nhow to evaluate the quality of data collected, and how to express your evidence-based argument in clear, simple prose, using APA format, to a skeptical reader\n\nTo provide you opportunity to learn these skills, the course expects you to complete two projects: one quantitative, one qualitative. In each project, you will:\n\nframe one or more questions to guide inquiry into a problem of practice\nselect a research method appropriate to the nature and purpose of your inquiry question/s,\nconceptualize and design a small study using your selected research method,\ndesign or select instrumentation to collect data,\ncollect a small sample of data,\ncritically evaluate the quality of your data\ndraw any appropriate inferences or make any appropriate claims from your study."

    "section": "A Case Study",
    "text": "A Case Study\nIn 2006, all public high schools in Washington State were required to administer the state’s large-scale assessment, the Washington Assessments of Student Learning (WASL) in mathematics and reading, to all tenth grade students. By law, these students were the first graduating class required to pass the test in order to receive their high school diplomas. High stakes accountability testing was getting “real.”\nPublic educators throughout the state were anxious. Questions abounded:\n\nHow many students would meet the standard? How close are we?\nWhich students are less likely to reach the standard?\nWhat reforms, interventions, or other restructuring are necessary in elementary and middle school to better prepare students for the high school proficiency standard?\nWhat exactly are the high school proficiency standards in reading and math?\nWhat reforms, interventions, or other restructuring are necessary in high school to better prepare students who failed the test in tenth grade to pass the test by their senior year?\n\nThis state policy was controversial. Many people decried the requirements as fundamentally unfair. Leading psychometricians (experts in test design) criticized the high stakes policies as invalid uses of (largely high quality) standardized tests. Some public educators retired early or found other jobs. Others defended the policies as necessary to bring about long overdue reforms.\nAt the time, I was somewhere in the middle. It was early in my career in public education. I was employed as a data analyst in my district’s curriculum and instruction department, and on the side I was working on my doctorate. My job, in essence, was to help educators understand student achievement data. I was unique because I had come to education not from classroom teaching but the academic world: sociology. I cared what data said. Here are the kinds of questions I asked at the time:\n\nWhat is the historical and/or social scientific evidence that these high stakes accountability testing policies actually work? Where and when have these policies already worked?\nAnd what does “actually work” really mean: To improve instruction? To help students overcome demographic disadvantages? \nPart of the theory of action of these accountability policies is “measurement-driven instruction”: testing data should provide instructionally valuable feedback. Teachers should look at data; and when they do, they should see and do …. what?\n“Data-based decision-making” is all the rage. But what exactly does it mean for a district or school to be “data-driven”? What decisions? What data? Might this look very different from one district or school to another?\nHow does a district or school become “data-driven”? By what process of evolution?\nHigh school teachers already see state assessment at a high level in the summer during inservice days. How often do they look at the state assessment data for their own students? And when they do, how much instructional utility do they derive from the data?\nThe policies assume that external accountability pressure will cause teachers to look at data. Can I test that empirically? Do teachers who perceive more pressure tend to look at state assessment data more often than teachers who perceive less pressure?\nProfessional learning communities are hailed as a very effective model for organizing and motivating teachers to collaborate. Are high school teachers in professional learning communities more likely to use high school assessment data to improve instruction than those not in professional learning communities?\n\nAfter 16 years, these questions probably sound dated now. They were on a par with what people were writing at the time and they lended themselves readily to disciplined, systematic inquiry data. More to the point, let’s consider the different kinds of research questions in this topic."

    "text": "Questions for quantitative data\nThe quantitative questions are fairly obvious:\nHow often do high school teachers use state assessment data? This is a question is a no-brainer because it is about frequency, which ranges from less frequent (“hardly ever’) to more frequent (”all the time”). To study this I needed a sample of teachers who varied in their use of data along this range of frequency.\nAre teachers who perceive more external accountability pressure to improve test scores more likely to examine their own students’ state assessment data more often? This too is an unmistakably quantitative research question (or hypothesis). Implied is comparison between two groups (which is “more likely”) along scales of intensity for accountability pressure (less to more intense), frequency (“rarely” to “often”) of data use. To study this I needed a sample of teachers who varied in their perceptions of accountability pressure and their frequency of data use.\nNotice that questions for quantitative data come from an understanding of the situation of enough sophistication to know what the important variables are and how the variables might be related (do the values of one depend on the values of the other). In most cases, quantitative analysis is deductive; we know what to look for and we understand the situation well enough to test competing theories or understandings.\nQuantitative methods are also appropriate when you want to make generalizations about a population. They seek to show what is generally true of a large number of “cases” (most often, people)."

Nothing here is quantified or quantifiable. The quest is for attributes or states of “data-driven”. The result could be a typology of different kinds of “data-driven”-ness. Or it could be some kind of evolutionary process with beginning and more advanced stages of development.\nWhat does it mean for a teacher to “use” state assessment data? “Using state assessment data” could mean different things among high schools than my understanding from the district office, the professional research literature, and my background in social science. I needed to talk to sample of teachers to ask them to describe in their own words how they use data.\nWhat sense do high school teachers make of state assessment data? Similar to the question above, I needed to ask teachers to describe what (if anything) they learn from state assessment data in their own words.\nFor each of these questions, the focus is full understanding of a small number of cases (most often, people). Generalization to a large population is NOT the point of qualitative methods. Qualitative methods aim to understand what is deeply true of a small number of cases."

    "text": "Your turn\nHaving considered the different angles for research in this case study, now think about your own problem of practice as it seems to you in your setting or milieu. Maybe this is your nascent capstone project.\nWrite down your guiding question/s that best capture your true interest.\nThen consider the words you’ve used.\nAre you looking to explore something that is not well understood? Do your questions seek understanding of kinds, ways in which, processes, stages, distinctions, classes, forms, and the like? Are these things you can average? (No?) Do you seek understanding of the mental models, theories, understandings, and the like, of how someone in your setting of interest perceives something, or understands what they’re doing? Do you want their own words? Are you interested in the “theory of action” behind a program or organization? Are you interested in identities and self-understandings? Are people’s own metaphors interesting to you? Do you want to deal primarily with “words” data? If yes, then you may be primarily interested in qualitative methods.\nDo you have a good enough understanding of your topic that you know what the important factors or variables are? Is one variable more important than another? Do you want a sense of scope, estimate, size, frequency, magnitude, intensity, extent, prevalence, risk, predictability, regularity, or relationship? Do you want to deal with primarily with “numbers” and “scale” data? If yes, then you may be primarily interested in quantitative methods.\nA final word, for now, about mixed methods:\nThere are good reasons to use mixed methods. You may want to collect some qualitative data (from interviews, observations) from a few cases to more deeply understand something. With better firsthand understanding you can then develop more accurate survey items, frame more relevant questions and hypotheses, and test competing explanations of something.\nMy doctoral dissertation was de facto mixed methods. It began with qualitative work. From my role in the central office I knew a lot about my topic from a global perspective and from the professional literature, but I did not understand teacher work life very deeply. Interviewing a small sample of them helped me better understand my topic from their perspective. But I didn’t stop there; I wanted to make generalizations to a population of teachers. Based on this more sophisticated understanding I was able to frame smarter research questions and better survey items and to specify and estimate more grounded statistical models. My quantitative dissertation study proper owes its quality to the preliminary qualitative work that informed it.\nMixed methods are possible, and may appeal philosophically: “Why choose between the two if I can do both? Wouldn’t mixed methods make the most sense and do the most justice to the topic?” True enough. And what more appropriate laboratory for learning different research methods than your doctoral program? But to do any research method well is to negotiate a learning curve, and your time and energy are limited in this fast-paced doctoral program. Do factor that into your discernment of methods. Whatever you decide, I will help you as best I can."

By the end of the instrument, respondents will tire and stop responding to items.\nThe survey uses so many open-ended items that it is collecting primarily qualitative data and is essentially an interview project.

    "section": "How to design a high quality survey",
    "text": "How to design a high quality survey\nUse these steps, selected from the literature and my own professional experience doing dozens of surveys over the years, to design a high quality survey:\n\n1. Clarify the purpose of your survey.\nBegin by considering why choose a survey instead of another method to answer your question. Why is a survey appropriate for your question?\nWhat is the time frame for your survey? Will it be a timely, issue-specific “fact-finding” survey that reveals “How many people think X?” about a specific issue (such as a curriculum adoption, or a bond election)? Will the survey lose its relevance after the moment has passed? Or does your survey aim to measure something ongoing in the culture (like a school climate survey) and thus be used multiple times to build trend data?\nWill the data be used to quantify the magnitude of sentiment, attitude, opinion, or behavior? Will the data be used to describe a population? Will the data be used to compare groups on a sentiment, attitude, opinion, or behavior? Or could your data be used to explain which variables are stronger predictors of an outcome than others?\n\n\n2. Draft a map of the survey.\nDesigning a good survey is much like designing a good student achievement test. The starting point for a student achievement test is not test questions, it is a map of the different learning objectives. The same goes with a survey. A survey project should begin with a high level list of the overall questions one wants answered.\n\n\n3. Sample carefully.\nWhat is the sampling method? Is it a convenience sample of people available? If so, what are some sources of sampling bias? What relevant respondents might be left out? What profit might you gain from select a probability sample?\n\n\n4. Use validated items from other established survey instruments, or write your own high quality items.\nLearn from the experts, when possible:\n\nWriting Survey Questions (The Pew Research Center)\nBest Practices (Washington State University)\n\nKeep survey items short and simple. Avoid long, wordy items that could confuse the respondent.\nAvoid double-barreled items. Keep survey items focused on one dimension at a time. (I saw this in education over and over and over again.)\nDon’t lead or force data from the respondent. Example: Many times I have heard people intentionally withhold a “Neutral/No Opinion” category in order to “force” the respondent to take a stand on an issue. I don’t like that practice. If a respondent truly does not understand or have an opinion about a topic, I would rather know that than force the respondent to yield an artificial (and, in my mind, invalid) response.\nAllow response categories that span the range of all possible responses. Response categories on a survey item should be exhaustive and mutually exclusive. This assumes you know the full range of possible responses. If you don’t, consider asking this item first as an open-ended item on a pilot survey. Then you can ask it as a closed item on your operational survey.\nBe judicious in your use of open-ended items. Allowing respondents to respond in their own words will create a large volume of comments that will take time to read, and many of the comments say similar things. Use open-ended items on a pilot instrument when you don’t fully understand an issue and want to see the full range of possible types of responses to it. These types of responses can then become response categories on a closed item on an operational version of the survey.\n\n\n5. Pilot the questionnaire before going live.\nShow the questionnaire to a small sample of intended respondents. Ask them to take the survey, noting the following:\nConfusion. Is the purpose of the survey clear to the respondent? Is any part of it confusing to the respondent in any way? Are any items confusing as worded?\nBias. Does the survey truly capture the full scope of respondent experience on the issue? Are some options left out? Do some items lead or force the respondent?\nLength. Is the survey an appropriate length? Does the survey tire out respondent? Aim for no longer than 15 minutes.\nValidity. Does the survey capture the thinking, (mis)conceptions, ideas, beliefs, sentiments, attitudes, opinions, and/or behaviors you designed it to capture? Or does it also capture extraneous information? Use a “think aloud” method of asking the respondent to verbalize their responses as they take the survey.\nIn the field, there is not always time or interest to pilot a survey. But in my experience, when possible, piloting has always improved the quality of my surveys.\n\n\n\n\n\nBurkholder, G. J., K. A. Cox, L. M. Crawford, and Hitchcock. 2020.

    "section": "To evaluate a program",
    "text": "To evaluate a program\nIn education, we often design programs to improve instruction or aspects of schooling to improve outcomes for students. Most programs cost time, money, or other limited resources.\nConsider, for the moment, one program that perhaps you have led, implemented, inherited and maintained, or otherwise invested your attention into yourself. Inevitably the question will arise: How well is this program “working”? Do the benefits it yields outweigh the costs? These questions depend on a fundamental question which is our focus for this module:\nWhat counts as evidence? How can we know?\nWhen I worked in districts as the assessment director, questions of program evaluation came up many times. In many cases the originating question was, “Let’s look at the data!” and in most cases that really meant, “Some students were part of a program. Let’s look at their data.”\nOften the data were scores on a common assessment of student achievement. This included districtwide assessments like DIBELS, STAR, or MAP, or the annual state assessment such as the WASL, the MSP, or the SBA. Students were often selected for a program on the basis of low pretest scores (“Level 1s” and “Level 2s”) and the outcome measure was often the same assessment given in a later testing window.\nFavorable outcomes for this group then counted as sufficient evidence of program efficacy, and more often than not, the de facto evaluator was the person most invested in the program and bent on seeing it continue.\nSeldom did it occur to people (or if it did, nobody said anything) what would likely have otherwise happened to these students without experiencing the program. Were they better off experiencing this program than the likely alternative? What about very similar students who could have experienced this program but for whatever reason didn’t? What were their outcomes?\nThis whole discussion rests on philosophical assumptions (or commitments, or investments) that we can more or less systematically cause better student outcomes and more or less measure this causation. Put another way, it’s common to justify the merit or importance of one’s work with causal inferences that the work makes a difference.\nQuestions about how, when, on whom we collect, organize, and analyze evidence to make causal inferences are questions of research design. Design is the framework for a study."

It was in the air.” This threat to validity, an alternative explanation for the outcome of the experimental group apart from the treatment itself, is called history.\n“Of course their scores increased! Kids grow and mature anyway. Studies have shown gains in scores for kids with no formal schooling at all.” This threat to validity, an alternative explanation for the outcome of the experimental group apart from the treatment itself, is called maturation.\n“Of course their scores increased! Having already taken the third grade SBA test, they knew what to expect of the test. They knew how to take it.” This threat to validity, an alternative explanation for the outcome of the experimental group apart from the treatment itself, is called testing.\n“Of course their scores increased! The fourth grade SBA was easier for fourth graders than the third grade SBA was for third graders.” This threat to validity is called instrumentation.\n“Of course their scores increased! Students selected on the basis of extreme low scores will always score higher on average on the posttest because extreme low scores are extreme because of the combined effects of true achievement and measurement error.” This threat to validity is called statistical regression.\nEach of these is a threat to the internal validity of a program’s treatment. Internal validity is the “basic minimum without which any experiment is uninterpretable: Did in fact the experimental treatments make a difference in this specific experimental instance?” (Campbell and Stanley (1963), p. 5)\nCritics raise a couple of additional objections:\n“These results are limited. The students selected for the program were less impacted by poverty. They had more favorable demographics. They were different students!” This treat to validity is called selection bias.\n“These results are limited. The students selected for the program were able to use their advantages to learn at a faster rate.” This treat to validity is called selection-maturation interaction.\n“These results are limited. The students selected for the program were sensitive to the test. They knew they had scored below standard in the spring so they tried harder the next year.” This threat to validity is called reactive or interaction effect of testing. \n“These results are limited. The students selected for the program had been low and received more attention and knew that we’re watching them closely.” This threat to validity is called multiple-treatment interference.\nThese are threats to the external validity of a program’s treatment. External validity “asks the question of generalizability: To what populations, settings, treatment variables, and measurement variables can this effect be generalized?” Threats to external validity limit the generalizability of the results to broader populations.\nWhat do you make of these objections, in light of the data and what you know of the design of the treatment? Are some more credible than others?"

    "text": "Experimental design with random assignment\nThe argument for the program is that it dramatically helps struggling readers, which is to say, struggling readers are better off in the program compared similar students in Tier 1 classroom instruction. This is because similar students did not gain as much as students in the program. The argument thus hinges on the similarity of the two groups. Any alternative explanation for the improvement of the experimental group must apply to the comparison group.\nWhat if these students were assigned randomly to the conditions? This would have the effect of rendering pre-existing differences not statistically significant (that is, their differences were no more than we would expect to see by chance) … by design. This would strengthen the program advocates’ causal argument that (1) they were all the same students and (2) the program worked better than Tier 1 instruction.\nNow it is probably wise to let go of it. Assuming we were so inclined, it is seldom feasible to prospectively randomly assign students to conditions, or to keep treatments so cleanly isolated, in real schools, districts, and dioceses. Nor will it be possible for you to fully design and carry out a prospective experimental design with random assignment in your current doctoral program."

    "text": "Quasi-experimental designs\nIn lieu of a true experimental design, consider adding quasi-experimental designs to your toolbox. These are frameworks for collecting, organizing, and analyzing (primarily quantitative) data for causal inference – such as for program evaluation – that fall short of pure experimental design with random assignment, and therefore expose the evaluation to criticism. As Cox (in Burkholder et al. (2020), 56) puts it well: “The lack of random assignment in quasi-experimental designs means that the groups may not initially be equal or similar. This presents the challenge of ruling out other alternative explanations that could be responsible for any observed outcome.” Quasi-experimental designs use one or more work-arounds to mitigate various inescapable threats to validity. Consider three:\n\nThe Nonequivalent Control Group Design\nThis design comes from Campbell and Stanley (1963), who, at that time, claimed:\none of the most widespread experimental designs in educational research involves an experimental group and a control group both given a pretest and a posttest, but in which the control group and the experimental group do not have pre-experimental sampling equivalence. Rather, the groups constitute naturally assembled collectives such as classrooms, as similar as availability permits but yet not so similar that one can dispense with the pretest. (p. 17)\nCook and Campbell (1979) later saw the design as “perhaps the most frequently used design in social science research and is fortunately often interpretable. It can, therefore, be recommended in situations where nothing better is available” (103-4).\nHere is the design, and it is the design of the hypothetical example above:\n\n\n\nO\nX\nO\n\n\nO\n\nO\n\n\n\nThe design overcomes several of the critics’ objections raised above.\nHistory, maturation, testing, and instrumentation are less credible objections because each of these explanations would apply to both groups, and the students in the experimental classroom still outperformed their peers in the comparison classroom. Notice here the added value of a comparison group!\nStatistical regression is a valid criticism any time students are selected for a treatment on the basis of extreme scores, because extremely low or high pretest scores will always, on average, regress to the mean on any retest. This should be less of a problem if both groups were selected on the same set of extreme pretest scores.\nInteractions between pretesting, selection, maturation, and the experimental treatment mean the students selected for the treatment were aware of their selection and reacted to it. This could be a valid threat whenever students selected for a program become aware of it, especially by virtue of contact with comparison students.\n\n\nTime series\nA time-series design is, essentially, “the presence of a periodic measurement process on some group or individual and the introduction of an experimental change into this time series of measurements, the results of which are indicated by a discontinuity in the measurements recorded in the time series” (Campbell and Stanley (1963), 37).\nThe design looks like this:\n\n\n\nO1\nO2\nO3\nO4\nX\nO5\nO6\nO7\nO8\n\n\n\nConsider, for example, annual grade level test scores for schools in a district or diocese. A line graph of eight years of results might look like this:\n\nWhat does a time series enable us to see?\nIncreases since the intervention might look like evidence of the intervention’s effectiveness. A larger set of pre-intervention data provides context."

    "text": "How to do a program evaluation using a quasi-experimental design\nTo carry out a retrospective analysis of existing quantitative data using quasi-experimental design for the purpose of program evaluation, you need:\n\nA group of schools/students/people who experienced some initiative, program, or treatment of interest\nA comparison group of similar schools/students/people who did not experience the program or treatment of interest\nSome pretest data, to establish baseline differences. Maybe these pretest data were the basis for assignment to the initiative or program\nSome demographic data, to explore differences between the groups besides the treatment\nSome posttest data, to establish outcomes of both groups. Ideally the pretest and posttest are the same interest, but this is not required.\n\nConcretely, all this means:\n\nExcel or other spreadsheet software, and in your worksheets you need:\nA column of pretest scores on a population of schools or students\nColumns for demographic variables on this population of schools or students (gender, race, low income, English language proficiency)\nA column designating which schools or students participated in the initiative or program. Code the schoosl/students receiving the initiative/program as 1, all others 0.\nA column of posttest scores on this population If these data are coming from different places then you need some kind of key variable (such as an ID number) that is common across all the different data sources which you can use to match the data together\n\nYour end game is one spreadsheet where all of these variables are together in one place. Then you can use PivotTable to summarize the data. Keep checking back here for a sample Excel file as a guide."
